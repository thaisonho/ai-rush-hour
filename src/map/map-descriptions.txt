GROUP 1: FOUNDATIONAL & INTRODUCTORY MAPS (DIFFICULTY: LOW, < 15 MOVES)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
MAP 01: The Welcome Mat
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Difficulty: Very Low (~3 moves)
Structure: Straight Shot
Purpose: Serves as a fundamental sanity check to verify the correctness
of all algorithm implementations and establishes a performance
baseline under ideal, non-complex conditions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
MAP 02: The Dead End
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Difficulty: Unsolvable
Structure: Boxed-In / No Solution
Purpose: To test the completeness property of the search algorithms,
ensuring they can correctly identify a state space with no
solution and terminate gracefully without infinite loops.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
MAP 03: The Simple Choice
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Difficulty: Low (~5 moves)
Structure: Cost Dilemma
Purpose: Designed to create a clear choice between a path with fewer
moves but a higher cost, and a path with more moves but a lower
cost. This directly contrasts the optimality criteria of BFS
(shortest path) versus UCS (cheapest path).



#######
GROUP 2: ALGORITHM-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR MAPS (DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM, 10-30 MOVES)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
MAP 04: The Lure
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Difficulty: Medium (~14 moves)
Structure: Red Herring
Purpose: To demonstrate the non-optimal nature of Depth-First Search.
The map features an attractive but useless search path (a "trap")
that DFS is likely to explore deeply, leading to a significantly
longer solution path compared to optimal algorithms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
MAP 05: The Shallow Goal
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Difficulty: Medium (~20 moves)
Structure: Shallow Goal, Deep Trap
Purpose: To highlight the primary advantage of Iterative Deepening
Search (IDS) over a standard DFS. The optimal solution is at a
relatively shallow depth, but a very long, dead-end path exists
to trap DFS. IDS will efficiently find the shallow solution,
while DFS will be significantly delayed, showcasing IDS's utility.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
MAP 06: The Heuristic Trap
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Difficulty: Medium (~11 moves)
Structure: Misleading Heuristic State
Purpose: To demonstrate the limitations of a given heuristic. This map
is specifically crafted so that the heuristic provides a poor,
misleading estimate, causing A* to perform less efficiently and
explore more nodes than it would in a well-aligned scenario.



#######
GROUP 3: ADVANCED & COMPLEXITY-TESTING MAPS (DIFFICULTY: HIGH, >= 30 MOVES)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
MAP 07: The Time Sink
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Difficulty: High (~33 moves)
Structure: High Branching Factor at Early Depths
Purpose: To test the time complexity limits of IDS. The vast search
space at shallow depths makes the repetitive nature of IDS
prohibitively expensive, leading to a timeout. This contrasts
with DFS, which may still find a solution within the time limit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
MAP 08: The Funnel
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Difficulty: High (~33 moves)
Structure: Funnel
Purpose: To showcase the power and efficiency of A* search. The
solution requires a long, non-obvious sequence of moves to clear a
single "gatekeeper" vehicle. This is a scenario where a good
heuristic drastically reduces the search space compared to
uninformed methods like BFS and UCS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
MAP 09: The Complex Interlock
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Difficulty: Very High (~50 moves)
Structure: Tightly Constrained 
Purpose: A general-purpose hard puzzle to evaluate overall algorithm
performance under pressure. The high density and interlocking
nature of vehicles test the algorithms' ability to handle
complex local constraints and deep search paths.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
MAP 10: The Labyrinth
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Difficulty: Extremely High (~51 moves)
Structure: Ultimate Challenge
Purpose: To push all algorithms to their absolute limits. This map
combines multiple difficult patterns and has a very long optimal
solution, testing the boundaries of time, memory, and heuristic
effectiveness. It serves as the final stress test.
